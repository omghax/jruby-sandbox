JRuby Sandbox
=============

The JRuby sandbox is a reimplementation of _why's freaky freaky sandbox
in JRuby, and is heavily based on [javasand][1] by Ola Bini, but updated
for JRuby 1.6.

## Prerequisites

This gem requires JRuby 1.6. As of the time of this writing, it is known to
work with the latest stable version of JRuby, 1.6.3. You can install it via
RVM with the following command:

    rvm install jruby-1.6.3

## Install and usage via Rubygems

    gem install jruby_sandbox

## Basic Usage

Sandbox gives you a self-contained JRuby interpreter in which to eval
code without polluting the host environment.

    $  irb
    >> require 'rubygems'
    >> require "sandbox"
    >> sand = Sandbox::Full.new
    => #<Sandbox::Full:0x46377e2a>
    >> sand.eval("x = 1 + 2")
    => 3
    >> sand.eval("x")
    => 3
    >> x
    NameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for #<Object:0x11cdc190>

There's also `Sandbox::Full#require`, which lets you invoke
`Kernel#require` directly for the sandbox, so you can load any trusted
core libraries.  Note that this is a direct binding to `Kernel#require`,
so it will only load ruby stdlib libraries (i.e. no rubygems support
yet).

## Sandbox::Safe usage

Sandbox::Safe exposes an `#activate!` method which will lock down the sandbox, removing unsafe methods.  Before calling `#activate!`, Sandbox::Safe is the same as Sandbox::Full.

    $  irb
    >> require 'rubygems'
    >> require "sandbox"
    >> sand = Sandbox.safe
    => #<Sandbox::Safe:0x17072b90> 
    >> sand.eval %{`echo HELLO`}
    => "HELLO\n" 
    >> sand.activate! 
    >> sand.eval %{`echo HELLO`}
    Sandbox::SandboxException: NoMethodError: undefined method ``' for main:Object

Sandbox::Safe works by whitelisting methods to keep, and removing the rest.  Checkout sandbox.rb for which methods are kept.

Sandbox::Safe.activate! will also isolate the sandbox environment from the filesystem using FakeFS. 

     $  irb
     >> require 'rubygems'
     >> require 'sandbox'
     >> s = Sandbox.safe
     => #<Sandbox::Safe:0x3fdb8a73> 
     >> s.eval('Dir["/"]')
     => ["/"] 
     >> s.eval('Dir["/*"]')
     => ["/Applications", "/bin", "/cores", "/dev", etc.] 
     > s.activate!
     >> s.eval('Dir["/*"]')
     => [] 
     > Dir['/*']
     => ["/Applications", "/bin", "/cores", "/dev", etc.] 

## Building (when using via git clone rather than gem)

To build the JRuby extension, run `rake compile`. This will build the
`lib/sandbox/sandbox.jar` file, which `lib/sandbox.rb` loads.

## Known Issues / TODOs

  * There is currently no timeout support, so it's possible for a
    sandbox to loop indefinitely and block the host interpreter.
